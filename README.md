# Solana Sniper

This Node.js TypeScript application facilitates the sniping new pairs on Pump.fun in 0 slot timings. Txs patched and sent to all providers in 5ms window.

**!!! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RISKS AND FUNDS LOSS WHILE USING THIS TOOL !!!**

Integration with 0slot, nextblock ,astra and node1 providers.
Supports multiple region deployments (one node on the X region and replicas on Y regions)
Required shred access for fast transactions
You need to run your own node as well as redis (redis can be in docker)

PS. History purged bc I needed to push a lot of unredable commit messages to support running in multiple regions

Set the environment variables in a `.env` file:

## üì¶ Usage

Run the following commands from the root of the project:

```
npm run start
```
Runs the sniper and listens for new PumpFun pairs in full mode.

```
npm run start:minimal
```
Runs a lightweight version of the sniper (region copy without proper node)

```
npm run analyze
```
Analyzes recent trades or token launches for insights or patterns. Adds token wallets to whitelist to support sniping

```
npm run prod
```
Builds the project and starts it with high-memory and performance flags, suitable for production deployment.

```
npm run build
```
Compiles the TypeScript source and copies native modules and generated files into the `dist/` directory.

```
npm run build:napi
```
Compiles the native Rust module using N-API in release mode.
